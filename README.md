How to use Git, GitHub, and VSCode. 




# Definitions
<ul>
    <li><em>Branch:</em> a version of the main repository isolated from the live version, where you can edit files without worrying about other branches.</li>
    <li><em>Clone:</em> copy a remote repository from GitHub locally onto a machine. After cloning, it is possible to edit files in the repository locally and sync changes onto the remote repository.</li>
    <li><em>Commit:</em> save edits made to files to whichever branch you are working on. Commits also save commit messages, which records what edits were made.</li>
    <li><em>Fetch:</em> downloads data from a remote repository without changing local files.</li>
    <li><em>GIT:</em> a version control system which captures edits made to files as "snapshots", hence allowing you to track changes.</li>
    <li><em>Github:</em> stores Git repositories on the cloud and allows you to access/manage them online.</li>
    <li><em>Merge:</em> combine data from two different branches into one.</li>
    <li><em>Merge Conflict:</em> happens when branches with incompatible commits are merged. A merge conflict is resolved by selecting which changes should be kept in the final merge.</li>
    <li><em>Push:</em> updates a remote repository with edits from the local branch you are currently working on.</li>
    <li><em>Pull:</em> updates the local branch that you are currently working on with changes on the remote repository.</li>
    <li><em>Remote:</em> a repository stored on the cloud, which is the repository that changes are pushed onto. Could also refer to a Git command which lets you view and manage tracked repositories.</li>
    <li><em>Repository:</em> where team members can store files and code. Also tracks changes to these files and code, so edits made by each team member can be tracked and managed. Can be made public through GitHub to allow for public access.</li>
</ul>
